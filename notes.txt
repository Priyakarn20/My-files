difference between global, functional and block scope
scopes defines the boundary where we can access the variables and functions defined.
global variables are accessible everywhere in our file . 
eg. let a = 22; 
var b = 44; ... this is written in global scope .
variables declared inside function are accessible only in that particular function and not outside of it, known as functional scope .
variables declared in curly braces {}, accessible only in those braces and not ouside of it , known as block scope .

diff. between var, let and const
variables written by using var is global as well as functional scope. Var variables can be used again and again.
let and const ...block scope 
const variables have fixed value'

hoisting - a feature in which variable and function declaration move to top automatically .
